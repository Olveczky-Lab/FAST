Each data frame is 176 bytes multi-byte words are arranged in little-endian order (which is typically the default). The file is a sequence of 176 byte frames.
The structure of each frame is as follows:
Offset 0 bytes  : The first 8 bytes comprise a 64-bit header and is always equal to 0xC691199927021942. 
Offset 8 bytes  : The next 4 bytes represent a timestamp starting at 0 for the first frame, 1 for the next one and so on.
Offset 12 bytes : The next 2 16-bit words are unused.
Offset 16 bytes : The next 2 16-bit words contain the accelerometer, VDD and TEMP sensor data. 
Offset 20 bytes : The next 2 16-bit words are unused.
Offset 24 bytes : Then there are 64 16-bit words for each channel. 32768 corresponds to 0.0 and each step of 1 corresponds to 0.195uV. So 32769 is 0.195uV, 32767 is -0.195uV, etc. The first 16 bit word corresponds to Channel 0 (Channel 0 of Chip 0), the second one to Channel 32 (Channel 0 of Chip 1), the third one is Channel 1 (Channel 1 of Chip 0), the fourth one is Channel 33 (Channel 1 of Chip 1) and so on.
Offset 152 bytes: The remaining bytes in a frame are currently not used.
