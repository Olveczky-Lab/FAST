FAST Algorithm Parameters

Snippeting

BlockSize
EndPadding
WPre/WPost (Changing this will potentially break Clustering Steps that have hardcoded the number of samples per spike to be 64)
EventThreshold/ReturnThreshold
num_samples_return (dead time between spikes)
filter parameters (spikes bandpass and LFP downsample)

Clustering (both Level1 and Level2)

mintemp/maxtemp (could potentially make this more general)
featurefunc (currently just scaled raw spike waveforms, could do pca, wavelets, etc.)
numspikesperblock
spc parameters (swcycles knn seed)

Terminating
minclussize
recursive merging scoring function and threshold (currently change in SSE with a threshold of 20)

Level2
number of levels
minclussize 
minclusamp

AutoSorter
Segmentation fusion
	Num Blocks per fusion and num overlap
	link and node value functions
	maxtempnum
Straggler Distance function and Threshold

Merger
distance function and threshold (includes max tolerance for translation invariance)
