# FAST (Fast Automated Spike Tracker)
----

FAST is an automated, unsupervised algorithm for spike-sorting of continuously acquired (24/7) extracellular data recorded on arrays of single or grouped electrodes.

For more details on the algorithm, please refer to our preprint paper.

We are currently developing a user-interface that would make FAST easier to run on a variety of data-sets and platforms, but for now we provide the source code and executables as is. For any details not covered in this documentation, please [contact us](https://olveczkylab.oeb.harvard.edu/about).

## Computer requirements

The FAST algorithm is deployed on a scalable master-worker architecture. 

You will need to set up the following machine(s).

**Workstation**
A workstation is required to generate the properly formatted snippeting and clustering commands to be run on the distributed computing platform. 
You will need...
- F# development environment with ability to run F# scripts (.fsx) interactively. 
	Examples include...
	- Visual Studio 2013 or later.
	- Visual Code with Ionide plugin.
	
**Master and worker node(s)**
- 64 bit Windows 7 or above OS
- At least 8 GB RAM
	
Note that master and worker nodes are not required to be distinct machines - they could instead be different processes running in the same Windows environment (even, for example, on the workstation computer).	

## Installation

- Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Olveczky-Lab/FAST/tree/master/Releases) from the FAST github repository on your workstation PC.

- Set up master and worker nodes.
	- Install [.NET Framework 4.5](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653) on all nodes.
	- Deploy FAST on master and worker nodes.
		- Identify an unused port number on the worker nodes that will be used for communication with the master node (for example, port 8000).
		- Modify the following parameters in the **DeployFAST.ps1** script - *ReleasePath*, list of *computerNames* (can be names or IP addresses), *port*, *username* and *password* for all nodes.
		- If required, update the port number in the WorkerNodes / ProcessRunnerService / **ProcessRunnerService.exe.config** file.
		- Run **DeployFAST.ps1** in a powershell window on any PC with access to the nodes.
	- Copy the following powershell scripts from the *MasterNode* folder to the appropriate directories on the master node.
		- *SnippetAll.ps1*, *SnippetAllAmp.ps1*, *StartTTL.ps1* to the __C:\Titanic\Snippeter__ folder.
		- *StartClustering.ps1*, *StopClustering.ps1*, *StartTerminating.ps1*, *StartLevel2.ps1*, *StartAutoSorting.ps1* to the __C:\Titanic\Clusterer__ folder.
