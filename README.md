# FAST (Fast Automated Spike Tracker)
----

FAST is a largely unsupervised algorithm for spike-sorting of continuously acquired (24/7) extracellular data recorded on arrays of single or grouped electrodes.

For more details on the algorithm, please refer to our preprint paper.

We are currently developing a user interface that would make FAST easier to run on a variety of datasets and platforms, but for now we provide the source code and executables as is. For any questions or details not covered in the documentation, please [contact us](https://olveczkylab.oeb.harvard.edu/about).

## Computer requirements

The FAST algorithm is deployed on a scalable master-worker architecture. 

You will need to set up the following machine(s).

**Workstation**
A workstation is required to generate the snippeting and clustering commands that are later run on the distributed computing platform. 
- Windows 7 (64 bit) or later.
- F# development environment with ability to run F# scripts (.fsx) interactively. 
	Examples include...
	- Visual Studio 2013 or later. Ensure that you can run F# interactive as a 64-bit process (*Options > F# Tools*).
	- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Ionide](http://ionide.io/) plugin and [Visual F# Tools](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48179).
**Master and worker node(s)**
- Windows 7 (64 bit) or later.
- At least 8 GB RAM.

Note that master and worker nodes are not required to be distinct machines - they could also be different processes running in the same Windows environment (even on the workstation computer).	

## Installation

- Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Olveczky-Lab/FAST/releases/) from the FAST GitHub repository to your workstation PC.

- Set up master and worker nodes.
	- Install [.NET Framework 4.5](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653) on all Master and Worker nodes.
	- Set up worker nodes.
		- Identify an unused port number on the worker nodes that will be used for communication with the master node (for example, port 8000).
		- Modify the following parameters in the **DeployFAST.ps1** script.
			- If necessary, modify *ReleasePath* (line 2) to point to the */Releases/1.0/WorkerNodes/* folder.
			- list of *computerNames* (line 8; these are the network names or IP addresses of the computers you intend to use as worker nodes)
			- *port* (line 16; this is the port that will be used for communicating with the Master node)
			- Administrator *username* and *password* for all nodes (line 12; to run powershell scripts remotely). Should be the same for all worker nodes.
		- Update the port number (line 16, same port number as above) and computer username (line 33) in the *WorkerNodes/ProcessRunnerService/**ProcessRunnerService.exe.config*** file. The default port number is 8000. All worker nodes must communicate over the same port number.
		- Run **DeployFAST.ps1** in a powershell window on any PC with network access to the nodes, such as your workstation.
		
		Note: If for some reason you cannot run **DeployFAST.ps1** remotely, follow the instructions in **DeployFAST_local.ps1** to manually install FAST on each Worker node.
	- Set up Master node.
		- Update the following Powershell scripts (*.ps1) in the *MasterNode* Release folder with the list of worker-nodes, their port numbers, and login (username + pwd) details -  **StartSnippeting.ps1**, **StartSnippetingAMP.ps1**, **StartTTL.ps1**, **StartClustering.ps1**, **StopClustering.ps1**, **StartTerminating.ps1**, **StartLevel2.ps1**, **StartAutoSorting.ps1**. 
		- FAST can spawn multiple snippeting or clustering worker processes on each worker node to optimize use of multiple-core CPUs. For a typical desktop PC with a hyper-threaded quad-core i7 processor and 32 GB RAM, we recommend 8 processes for **StartSnippeting.ps1** (line 24), **StartSnippetingAMP.ps1** (line 24), **StartClustering.ps1** (line 15) and **StartAutoSorting.ps1** (line 15). You may want to benchmark the optimal number of processes for your specific hardware configuration.
		- Copy **SnippetAll.ps1**, **StartSnippeting.ps1**, **StartSnippetingAMP.ps1**, **StartTTL.ps1** to the _C:\Titanic\Snippeter_ folder on the designated Master node.
		- Copy **StartClustering.ps1**, **StopClustering.ps1**, **StartTerminating.ps1**, **StartLevel2.ps1**, **StartAutoSorting.ps1** to the _C:\Titanic\Clusterer_ folder on the designated Master node.
	

- Install REST service (blobserver) on your data server. 
	In our current implementation of the FAST algorithm, the worker nodes send web requests to send and receive data from the data server. To allow this communication you will have to install a simple RESTful web service that we call a blobserver on your data server. 
	- If your data server runs Windows 7 (x64) or above, you can make a local copy of the **blobserver.exe** file, then open a command prompt terminal and start the blobserver by typing the following command. 
	`blobserver.exe 8001` 
	or 
	`blobserver.exe 8001 >nul` to suppress program output.
	Here `8001` represents an open TCP port - you could use any available TCP port.
	- If your data server runs a different OS, then you will need to build the included **blobserver.go** source code with the go compiler before running the executable.
	- You can check if your blobserver is functioning by opening up a browser window and entering a command such as	`http://IPaddress:port/size?FileName=Path` where `IPaddress:port` is specific to your blobserver and `Path` is the path to some local file on your data server. This command should return the size of that file in bytes.
	
- Modify paths in **StartSnippeting.fsx** and **StartClustering.fsx** to point to the IP address and location of data on the data server (see comments in scripts for more details).

## Recording file format

- [RHD file format](./RHDFormat.txt): This is similar to IntanTech's native [RHD2000 format](http://intantech.com/files/Intan_RHD2000_data_file_formats.pdf), and includes data recorded from auxiliary channels on the RHD2000 Intan chips, chip supply voltages and FPGA board TTL inputs, in addition to the voltage recordings from the electrode array.

- [AMP file format](./AMPFormat.txt): This contains only the voltage recordings. 

FAST is currently limited to processing data files recorded on 64 channel electrode arrays. If your data is recorded on fewer channels you will need to pad it with zeros up to 64 channels. 
We have provided a MATLAB function **[convertToAMP.m](./Utilities/convertToAmp.m)** that you can use to convert your data files to our AMP file format.

## Snippeting

You will need to run **StartSnippeting.fsx** in an F# interactive window within your preferred development environment. If using Visual Studio, you should enable running F# interactive as a 64-bit process in *Options > F# Tools*.

- Specify the grouping of channels in your electrode array. We have included options for single electrodes and tetrodes (channels grouped by default as `{0,1,2,3},{4,5,6,7},...,{60,61,62,63}`), but you can also specify your own custom grouping by editing the .fsx script.

- Specify whether the files are in RHD or AMP format in the .fsx script.

- Specify the grouping of channels for median subtraction. By default there are two groups comprising channels `{0,...,31}` and `{32,...,63}` which correspond to the chip grouping of channels on our custom 2X RHD2132 Intan headstage.

- List the files you want to snippet, either in the .fsx script or in an external text file (see **snippeting_list_example.txt**). For each file, you can specify an optional list of channels to exclude (here, channel numbers are 1-indexed, so `{1,...,64}`) as well as the number of frames/samples to snippet (optional, in case the end of the recording is corrupted).

- Now run the **StartSnippeting.fsx** script in [F# interactive](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/tutorials/fsharp-interactive/). Then enter the command `initall();;` in the interactive window. This will do the following...
	- Create the required directory structure for each recording file.
	- Create a *SnippeterSettings.xml* definition for each recording. This file contains all information about the recording to be snippeted such as channel grouping, spike detection and return to baseline thresholds, blockSize, snippet size, samples per block, median reference channel groups, etc. You can modify specific attributes in this XML file if you would like to change particular snippeting parameters.
	- Generate a list of snippeting 'in' and 'out' paths in the F# interactive window. 
	
-  Copy and paste the snippeting 'inpaths' and 'outpaths' from the F# interactive window on your workstation to the **SnippetAll.ps1** script in the *C:\Titanic\Snippeter* folder on the Master node. Modify lines 20-21 in this script depending on whether you are snippeting RHD or AMP files.

- To launch the snippeting process on the Worker nodes, open a powershell window on the Master node and run the command 
`C:\Titanic\Snippeter\SnippetAll.ps1 IPaddress:port`
where the argument "IPaddress:port" corresponds to the address of the RESTful service (blobserver) that is running on your data server (e.g. `C:\Titanic\Snippeter\SnippetAll.ps1 192.168.0.1:8001`). 

The snippeting process should generate two files for each channel grouping.
- A SpikeTimes file with a list of sample numbers for detected events at *uint64* precision.
- A Spikes file with the waveforms of the detected events in *int16* precision. Each event waveform comprises *nchannels X 64 samples* 16-bit words arranged in the order `[Ch0-Sample0, Ch1-Sample0, Ch2-Sample0, Ch3-Sample0, Ch0-Sample1, etc.]`. To convert to units of voltage, change type to double precision and multiply by 1.95e-7.


## Clustering

- Update paths and addresses in **StartClustering.fsx**.

- Specify 'rat' name - this is just the name of the folder containing the collection of data files that you would like to cluster.

- Add a list of file names you would like to cluster. Determine whether you would like to cluster all channel groups specified in *SnippeterSettings.xml* or a select set of channel groups by commenting/uncommenting appropriate sections of the .fsx script.

	*Note*: Make sure to delete any ChGroups folders that do not have any detected spikes and also remove these ChGroup definitions from the *SnippeterSettings.xml* file.

- Uncomment and run the code sections at the bottom of the .fsx script (Steps 1-9) one by one in the F# interactive window. Steps 2-8 will generate a list of clustering commands which have to be copied and pasted into a powershell window on the Master node. Begin each step only once the previous step has finished running.

If run successfully, the clustering steps should generate an ensemble of *MergedChains* within the ChGroup folders of every data file. These merged chains are the putative clusters generated by the fully automated steps 1 and 2 of FAST. For each merged chain cluster, the *\*.stimes* and *\*.snums* files contain the spike times and event numbers (*uint64* precision) in the parent *Spikes* or *SpikeTimes* files for that channel group.


## Manual inspection
To inspect and perform manual corrections of these clusters, we recommend using our [ChainViewer GUI](https://github.com/Olveczky-Lab/FAST-ChainViewer) written in Matlab.
